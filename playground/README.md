# `cooklang-rs` playground

To run, ensure that you have Rust and Node >v20 installed.

From the root after `npm i`, run the following to watch for changes and reload the playground.

```sh
npm run watch
```

This runs `wasm-pack` as required and Vitejs will reload the local development server as needed.
